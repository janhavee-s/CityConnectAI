# EcoPredict
🚀 Project Overview
EcoPredict is an AI-powered mineral resource forecasting and sustainability analytics system designed to support data-driven decision-making in resource planning and inventory management.

The system analyzes 10 years of historical mineral demand data and generates 1–12 month forecasts using statistical (ARIMA) and machine learning (Random Forest) models. It provides key performance metrics including forecast accuracy, demand trends, and confidence intervals to support planning decisions.

Beyond forecasting, EcoPredict evaluates inventory levels against recommended stock thresholds and highlights critical shortages. It also integrates sustainability metrics such as carbon factors and environmental impact scores for each mineral.

A key feature demonstrated in the video is the integration of a locally hosted LLM (Llama 3 via Ollama), which generates structured executive insights based on forecast outputs. This combines predictive analytics with AI-generated strategic interpretation.

The project demonstrates the integration of time-series modeling, machine learning, sustainability analysis, and generative AI within a FastAPI-based backend system, forming a prototype decision-support platform for mineral resource management.
